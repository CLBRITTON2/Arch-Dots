# Arch Linux Hyprland Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for a Hyprland-based Arch Linux setup.

## Overview
These dotfiles are symlinked to my `~/.config` folder. There's no install script at the moment.

### Included Configurations
The dotfiles include configurations for the following tools:
- **Hyprland**: Window manager
- **Dunst**: Notification daemon
- **Hypridle**: Idle management
- **Hyprlock**: Screen lock
- **Kitty**: Terminal emulator
- **Rofi**: Application launcher
- **Swaync**: Notification center
- **Waybar**: Status bar
- **Waypaper**: Wallpaper manager
- **Neovim**: Text editor (Note: My Neovim configuration is hosted separately at [lazyvim-config](https://github.com/CLBRITTON2/lazyvim-config))

## Credits
This setup started as a [ML4W Dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) install that I've manually uninstalled and written over time.
